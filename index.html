  <div class="entry__summary">Nobody agrees on what ended the world. Some say the bombs did it. Some say the plagues. Some say the last governments tried to &quot;clean up&quot; what the bombs couldn&#39;t, and finished the job with science that never should&#39;ve left a lab.

What everyone agrees on is this: the sky burned red for weeks, the radios filled with screams and orders that contradicted each other, and then the orders stopped. Cities didn&#39;t die all at once. They hollowed out. Roads became graveyards. The people who stayed above ground learned new laws fast: water is worth more than gold, a working engine is a miracle, and anything that still beeps from before the war is either salvation or a trap.

Now the world is a patchwork of blasted zones and half-safe routes, ruled by whoever can hold a well, a bridge, or a fuel cache. Gangs ride painted bikes through the hot sands. Scavengers pick the bones of old highways. Somewhere beneath it all, people whisper about sealed places with clean air and working lights, watching the surface like it&#39;s a punishment story.

Today you&#39;re doing what you always do: risking death for a chance at tomorrow. You&#39;ve heard of a pre-war stash, and you&#39;ve got something rare: a new map that threads through the high-radiation zones where others won&#39;t go. You set out into wind that tastes like metal, following faded landmarks toward a promise you don&#39;t fully believe.

And out here, belief doesn&#39;t keep you alive. Decisions do.</div>

  <div class="entry__summary">For a breath the world goes thin: the feed of a battered field console clicks to black, the little speaker grille on the salvage rig refuses its sputter of narration, and the wind takes the phrase &quot;muted&quot; and wears it like a pebble. Silence settles wrong over the impact crater &mdash; not peaceful, but expectant &mdash; making every scrap of movement sound like a declaration. Far off, a pack of cyber-jowls barks once and then falls into a cautious, mechanical chew; near at hand, the crashed escape capsule is a smoking husk with its hatch yawned and an old man&rsquo;s breath rasping into the red air.

He manages fragments between coughing fits: a satellite that hums like a dying bell, failsafes unwinding, a second guardian gone walking with purpose. Tracks lead from the crash into dust where the fog begins, wide tread marks dented like the teeth of a plow. The memory module inside the capsule glows faintly, a heartbeat of encrypted light that refuses to speak cleanly &mdash; its signal is a murmur, slurred and partial, as if someone has turned the world&rsquo;s voice low. In the hush you hear the hard certainty in that other tread, the purposeful steps of a man remade to finish an old promise; in the hush you also hear the weight of decision settling onto you.</div>

  <div class="entry__summary">MAAAGIC SHU SHU welcomes everyone as John Napiorkowski jokes that this is an early version and mentions a quieter assistant and his &quot;slappy joe.&quot; John confirms he&rsquo;s drinking water and says he needs to cut back. MAAAGIC SHU SHU quotes Churchill-style line about speech and damage, then prompts introductions. John and the group confirm links to a website with character sheets and an AI transcriber; John calls the session an experiment and says he&rsquo;s running a few minutes late because his workplace website was down. Skip Lipman struggles with audio but greets the table and talks about motorcycle repairs&mdash;changing to chrome hand controls, a pinched wire, throttle and idle issues&mdash;and mentions a returning mechanic who had been fired for drinking. Skip also recounts a recent data drive failure that wiped his computer and refers to someone called &quot;bean scotty&quot; or a computer person. NIX (Irradiated Shadow) notes he told that person about the game and that the person might join, and John steps away briefly to wash his hands while the group waits. The conversation trails off with Skip mentioning a &quot;disc drill program&quot; that mirrored data before the transcript ends.</div>

  <div class="entry__summary">MAAAGIC SHU SHU welcomes everyone to the game while John Napiorkowski explains this is an early version that &quot;doesn&#39;t speak this time&quot; and that he&#39;s running an experiment. John says there&#39;s a little more of his &quot;best slappy joe&quot; and that he&#39;ll get started after finishing his sloppy joes, then confirms he chose water as his beverage to cut back. MAAAGIC jokes about Churchill and asks who is playing which character, then introduces himself as Nick and prompts Skip for his character while Skip remains muted. Skip Lipman reports no audio and later says he can never get audio right, notes the transcriber and live chronicles link, and confirms he sees the character sheets on the shared website. John acknowledges the experiment may &quot;crash and burn,&quot; mentions he was running late because a work website was down, and thanks people for showing up early. Skip talks about life at the cycle shaft, describing problems with his bike after swapping to chrome hand controls that may have pinched a wire and caused parts to move more than he&#39;d like, and mentions an old mechanic who has come back and redeemed himself. Skip also recounts a data loss from a drive failure and how a &quot;disc drill&quot; program and help from a computer person let him recover almost a decade&#39;s worth of work. NIX (Irradiated Shadow) confirms he told that computer person about tonight&#39;s game and that the computer guy joined their game.</div>

MAAAGIC quotes Churchill about what comes out of the mouth, and then asks who the muted player will be; the group identifies that player as Skip. John confirms everyone has the link to the website with character sheets and the AI transcriber and calls the session an experiment he expects may &quot;crash and burn.&quot; Skip Lipman talks about shop life: changing to chrome hand controls on his bike, pinching a wire so the throttle and idle move more than he&#39;d like, and that an old mechanic has come back to work and redeemed himself with the owners. Skip also recounts a data loss when a drive failed, but says a disc-mirroring program&mdash;helped by someone he calls &quot;bean scotty the bean&quot;&mdash;let him recover almost a decade&#39;s worth of work. NIX (Irradiated Shadow) says he told that computer guy about the game and that the guy might join tonight.

  <div class="entry__summary">MAAAGIC SHU SHU welcomes everyone and John Napiorkowski explains this is an early version that doesn&#39;t speak, then jokes about his &quot;best slappy joe&quot; while saying he chose water to drink. John confirms everyone got the website link with character sheets and the AI transcriber, and calls the session an experiment &mdash; a &quot;zero level&quot; run he expects might crash and burn. Skip Lipman and others trade small talk: Skip describes changing his bike&#39;s hand controls to chrome, pinching a wire, and a recently returned mechanic redeeming himself with the shop owners. Skip recounts a hard data loss from a failed drive, how a contact helped recover most data by mirroring the disk, and warns that digital storage can vanish without hard copies. NIX (Irradiated Shadow) says he told a friend about the game and mentions his character Nick can see in the dark. John notes the transcriber is listening and attempting to create eventive summaries. The group pivots to films when Skip brings up Threads as an especially bleak nuclear-war movie; Skip and John discuss its lack of heroes, time jumps, and scenes of people trapped in bunkers. They talk about the film&#39;s aftermath &mdash; ozone damage, increased radiation, cancers, and a mutated child as the film&#39;s closing image. John says he&#39;ll wash his hands and be right back.</div>

  <div class="entry__summary">John Napiorkowski opens the session, noting this is an early version that &quot;doesn&#39;t speak this time&quot; and mentioning he&#39;s got sloppy joes before they start. MAAAGIC SHU SHU asks John what beverage he chose; John says just water and they exchange a brief Churchill quip. Players sort out audio: Skip Lipman is muted at first and reports no audio but eventually joins the conversation. John confirms everyone got the link to the website with character sheets and the AI transcriber, explains the session is an experiment and that the transcriber is listening and attempting to create summaries. Skip talks about changing his bike controls, a returning mechanic, and a recent data loss that he recovered using a disk-mirroring program; NIX (Irradiated Shadow) acknowledges and says he told a friend about the game who might join. The group discusses the film Threads and its bleak depiction of nuclear aftermath; Skip and John describe how the movie follows ordinary people through immediate collapse and a grim long-term decline. NIX mentions his character Nick can see in the dark and references radiation. IAM&amp;AW Nipsic Local 282 reports having an &quot;emergency bottle of whiskey.&quot; John asks if anyone read the intro; after IAM&amp;AW confirms, John summarizes the game&#39;s setting: no one knows exactly how the world ended&mdash;plagues, bombs, governmental collapse are possible causes&mdash;and the player group are wanderers in the wasteland chasing rumors of a pre-war stash of technology.</div>

  <div class="entry__summary">MAAAGIC SHU SHU opens the session and welcomes everyone while John Napiorkowski notes the setup is an early version and that he&rsquo;ll get started after finishing his sloppy joe and water. Players confirm they received the website link with character sheets and the live AI transcriber; John calls the session an experiment and says the transcriber is listening and meant to produce summaries. Skip Lipman and others trade small talk about real-life errands&mdash;Skip describes changing bike hand controls and a recent data loss that was mostly recovered with a disc-mirroring tool. NIX mentions telling a friend about the game and says his character can see in the dark, a radiation-tinged trait. The group discusses the film Threads and its bleak depiction of nuclear aftermath, touching on themes of nuclear winter, ozone damage, mutation, and the absence of hopeful rebuilding. IAM&amp;AW Nipsic Local 282 jokes about an emergency bottle of whiskey. John then reads the game intro: nobody knows exactly how the world ended&mdash;plagues, bombs, government collapse are all possibilities&mdash;and the players are scavengers in the wasteland. He presents the immediate hook: the party is searching for a rumored pre-war stash of technology and supplies. John adds the party has an edge: a map-like device that shows radiation zones and how they shift with the time of day.</div>

  <div class="entry__summary">John Napiorkowski explains the party is moving through radiation zones toward a stash and takes the only viable route: a wide canyon. As they enter the canyon, John describes growling ahead and then behind them. The group looks up to see large, scarred dogs stepping forward on both sides of the canyon. John emphasizes one dog is much larger than the rest and that the pack appears unusually well-muscled and not like typical lean wasteland dogs. Skip Lipman asks whether these are normal wasteland dogs or augmented beasts that might be negotiable. John has Skip assess the animals and then tells him what he sees; on recognizing the beasts as out of the ordinary, Skip begins casting ESP. John says they will try to talk it out first, and that he will go around the players to have everyone declare their actions as they resolve the encounter over Zoom.</div>

  <div class="entry__summary">John narrates the party moving through radiation zones toward the stash and taking a wide canyon as the only viable route. As they enter, growls come from ahead and then from behind; shapes of large, scarred dogs step up on both sides. John points out one dog is noticeably bigger than the others and that these animals look muscular and well-fed rather than the lean, battered wasteland dogs the group expects. He asks what the party plans to do and says he&#39;ll go around to hear everyone&#39;s choices. Skip asks whether the dogs are ordinary wasteland beasts or augmented with higher intelligence they could negotiate with. John has Skip look them over and then describes the dogs again as the largest one steps forward. Skip says that as soon as he recognizes the beasts are out of the ordinary he begins casting ESP. John acknowledges Skip&#39;s plan and tells the group they will try to talk it out first.</div>

  <div class="entry__summary">John Napiorkowski describes the dogs: they have a red light and beeps, and you can hear the beeping. He says their lights flash in coordination&mdash;the lead dog&rsquo;s light flashes, then the others&rsquo;, and when the lights flash the dogs begin to move and flank. John notes the animals feel controlled and not like normal wasteland dogs, appearing more coordinated and almost mechanical. He tells the group you pick up on this because of a good roll. John turns to Stan and asks for his declared action. IAM&amp;AW Nipsic Local 282 (Stan) pulls out a bow staff to keep distance, says he doesn&rsquo;t want to take damage, and looks beyond the dogs to see if anything is joining them or if a larger pack or follow-up is coming.</div>

  <div class="entry__summary">John Napiorkowski describes a pack of dogs with red lights that beep and flash in unison; the light seems to hit the lead dog and immediately copy to the others, who then begin to flank. He notes their movements feel controlled and almost mechanical, unlike typical wasteland dogs, and tells the players they notice that because of a good roll. John then turns to Stan and asks for his declared action. IAM&amp;AW Nipsic Local 282 (Stan) says he draws a bow staff to keep distance, avoid taking damage, and watches past the dogs to see if a larger pack or other hazards are following. John requests that Stan make an intelligence check and asks him to report whether he succeeds.</div>

IAM&amp;AW Nipsic Local 282 says they let everyone know, confirms they are playing the monk, admits they are stoned, and &mdash; unusually excited &mdash; shouts that more beasts are coming and that they can see them. NIX (Irradiated Shadow) declares they will channel Shadow Step to teleport from shadow to shadow, move behind the dogs, and try to see the device on their necks before attacking with a dagger. NIX clarifies the plan: get behind the lead dog and aim for the collar so removing it might stop the others. John explains the battlefield: a smaller group in front with a lead dog and a larger group behind, about six or seven, moving and dodging behind rocks so they&rsquo;re hard to track. John asks about cookies, notes the cookies are all gone, and thanks someone for the last one. The players&rsquo; intentions are set and positions described; the scene is poised for NIX&rsquo;s infiltration behind the dogs.</div>

IAM&amp;AW Nipsic Local 282 confirms they&rsquo;re playing the monk and, unusually excited, warns everyone that more beasts are coming. John asks for declared actions and NIX (Irradiated Shadow) says they will channel Shadow Step to teleport from shadow to shadow, get behind the dogs, check for a device on their necks, and attack with a dagger. John clarifies there&rsquo;s a group in front and a larger group in back; the front group is smaller but contains the lead dog. NIX says they&rsquo;ll try to remove the collar from the lead dog so the others might follow, and reiterates the plan to shadow jump beyond them and aim for the collar. John moves to initiative using classic d6s and announces the dogs roll a four; NIX notes their dexterity bonus applies. John also remarks that the cookies are all gone and thanks someone.</div>

Skip Lipman says &quot;esp goes off.&quot; John asks who goes when; Skip, NIX (Irradiated Shadow), and IAM&amp;AW Nipsic Local 282 volunteer&mdash;NIX says he has a five and Nipsic says he has a six, so John tells Nipsic he goes first. Nipsic says he will break out space and perform a defensive twist with his bo staff, sweeping a full arc to keep enemies at a distance and explicitly offers to protect Skip while Skip channels a power. John accepts that positioning. NIX declines to be the front-line fighter, says he&#39;s the voice/face, and moves to take cover behind a big rock. John gives him that cover and checks the dogs. NIX aims at the lead dog and lands a hit that deals three points of damage to the main dog. John then reports that NIX&#39;s follow-up strike hits near a metal object but only glances it because it appears to be made of tough, rusty pre-war metal.</div>

  <div class="entry__summary">John Napiorkowski confirms the game tools are working and then asks who acts first. IAM&amp;AW Nipsic Local 282 says he has initiative and says he will break out space and use a defensive bo staff maneuver to keep the threats at a distance, trying to cover the party while Skip Lipman works. John notes Skip&rsquo;s ESP or spell is active and agrees Nipsic is defending Skip&rsquo;s back; Nipsic puts his effort into that defense and succeeds. NIX (Irradiated Shadow) also wins the turn and says he&rsquo;s not a fighter, so he takes cover behind a rock and aims at the lead dog to protect the group. John tells NIX the aimed shot is harder but NIX hits the main dog and deals some damage. NIX then makes a percentile check against a nearby object; his attack strikes near it but the object proves to be tough, pre-war metal and does not give. The turn ends with NIX shadow-stepping to the back while Skip continues his spellcasting.</div>

John confirms NIX succeeded and says, &quot;he used you.&quot; NIX notes their intelligence is much higher. John remarks that intelligence helps a thief but you also have to be willing to take chances. NIX asks if they stole from that biker gang. John describes hearing someone stumble behind them, stepping back, and seeing a little dust by the rocks. NIX calls out that there&#39;s someone by those rocks, &quot;the controller.&quot; John shifts to Skip and says he didn&#39;t give details about the ESP. Skip explains the effect depends on the ESP and its limitations, says he can sense presence even through a door, and that he planned to probe the lead dog&rsquo;s mind while reaching outward to detect unseen beings; he adds the deeper probe allows those targets to resist. John and Skip acknowledge those intentions and limits.</div>

John tells Skip he can try to sense along that bearing, and Skip decides to do so. John narrates Skip zoning in and experiencing a disturbing mental impression: the target is a crazed wastelander, a loner with a sharp mind who briefly notices being sensed and reacts with surprise and fear. John says the man had violent intent but becomes confused; after a moment he manages to hold onto a kind of invisibility-like mental projection, though Skip can now partially perceive him. Skip turns toward the source and proclaims, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the prophet,&rdquo; warning them not to sacrifice their dogs and insisting they do not wish to kill the man, demanding he drop his invisibility and prepare to defend himself. John frames this as an attempt to intimidate a hardened crazy and asks how effective the intimidation is. Skip adds that he intends to reach into the man&rsquo;s mind.</div>

Players protest they don&#39;t want to hurt the pack; Skip urges using them and NIX notes he heard the dogs. IAM&amp;AW Nipsic Local 282 mentions a hospital and warns that a flesh wound can lead to infection. John explains the dogs try to get past Stan; one almost does but Stan pushes it back, while another manages to get past and goes at Stan.

John explains the new med kit appears to be a step above Vault-made gear and talks through tiers of looting and salvaging parts. Mid-search the party hears an explosion and distant shouting; John asks if they keep looting or investigate. The group decides to follow the tracks toward the explosion; NIX (Irradiated Shadow) volunteers to move ahead to scout but not fall too far behind, and the party moves out in that direction.</div>

  <div class="entry__summary">John Napiorkowski narrates Nick scouting up to the dune and finding a scene of burning bikes and bodies strewn on the ground. He describes bike tracks leading down into the deepest radiation zones; Nick thinks whoever rode that way won&#39;t make it, but the tracks continue. John says the scene looks like a hard, fast fight: one body appears dismembered, two are burned to the bone, the other bikes are smashed and fuel is spilled. It appears someone slaughtered the group, took one bike, and destroyed the others to prevent pursuit. One body twitches and seems to have been thrown some distance away. NIX signals for the others to rush up and Sister Mercy volunteers she has cure spells and med kits; the party fans out and keeps overwatch as they approach. Sister Mercy examines the wounded rider and sees his neck and back broken in multiple places; the man mumbles that &ldquo;the beast came out of the dunes,&rdquo; mentions &ldquo;metal,&rdquo; and says something about &ldquo;long red hair.&rdquo; Sister Mercy uses a lighter healing spell and a med kit to try to stabilize him so he can talk, but John says the injuries mean he will never walk or move again. John identifies the gang markings as those of the notorious radiation gang, explains their culture of riding into the zones and bearing burns, and the group hears NIX mention a drug that you spray on wounds that gets you high while healing a little.</div>

John describes a long red&#x2011;haired, metal figure that sees them. NIX suggests &quot;Barbara&quot; and asks about the fire; John explains the creature sprayed fire from its hands and burned his friends. John details how the creature tore a friend&#39;s arms and legs off, spewed fire, and left the witness for dead; the witness repeats that he is dead and cannot feel his feet. The witness tells them the creature spoke of history, declared them impure, and said it must cleanse the world to prepare the way for the end of history. Ember asks about the fog she came from; John says the fog washes people&#39;s minds, and those who go in come back different or never return. Stone names the Order of the Stillwater as his monastery; John recognizes it and Stone says the people he&rsquo;s looking for. Stone asks whether the witness&#39;s people fear or love their king; John reports the man looks confused and says, &quot;you are where you are... do not look.&quot; NIX urges sending the man on his way and Sister Mercy suggests giving him intoxicants to dull his pain; NIX volunteers to do it, and as they finish him off John shifts the scene while NIX says &quot;blood knife.&quot;</div>

The Prophet asks about the recent cyber-beast slaughter; John clarifies there were four bodies and a fifth man left with his back broken, the killings appearing to have happened in seconds. The Prophet reaches toward the man considering a mind-read to see if the dead were his kin, then contemplates telling him instead; NIX objects to the mental probe, John asserts the slain were members of the radiation gang and not the man&rsquo;s brothers, and The Prophet accepts that.</div>

  <div class="entry__summary">John Napiorkowski clarifies the rifle is a heavy, limited weapon as the scene continues. Kristen says she used a regular rifle shot, not a special shot, and hits the enemy in the shoulder&mdash;he bleeds and looks surprised. John notes Nick pushed a button while leaping and asks Kristen if she wants to use the rest of her action. NIX (Irradiated Shadow) wants to backstab but John explains a backstab is unlikely because the target is buried in a pile of rats; John suggests alternatives like shooting and then quick-stepping onto the rats, which would leave the attacker amid a pile. NIX decides to keep distance and fire, but John reports the gun jams and there&#39;s rat blood in it. Sister Mercy says she has no ranged options or spells and offers to heal; John holds her action. The Prophet asks whether the rats are positioned to trigger the beam weapon; John outlines the option to run out of the hut to shoot the rats toward the beam weapon to damage the base and possibly disrupt the man at the top, but warns about being exposed to the rats and notes the Prophet lacks the hound skill and is low on spells. The Prophet chooses to fire at the man and takes two shots, both of which miss. John moves the encounter forward, reports the party roll produces a low result that leaves the rat leader confused, then turns back to Kristen; she debates holding her action but ultimately decides to take her special &ldquo;jedi shot&rdquo; as NIX urges they finish the enemy.</div>

The pile of rats starts to grumble and begins to pull the man out toward the wasteland; the group debates whether to let him go or press the attack. The Prophet urges them to finish him, Carl says he won&#39;t let him go, and hound little Dave and others call to kill him. The party rushes the rat pile; John describes the man still ten feet up on the pile and warns that climbing will expose anyone to rats chewing at them. Hound little Dave says he&#39;ll leap up, asks about using his heavy chains as a weapon, and John allows swinging but insists he must first make the leap. Hound attempts the leap but fails to gain purchase and falls into the pool of rats. John says the rats begin to chew on him as the scene ends with the party pressing in on the writhing rat pile.</div>

  <div class="entry__summary">John Napiorkowski warns the group the attacker is fast and already brings a pickaxe down. The Prophet grabs the attacker&#39;s wrist and says he uses his psychic touch to sense the man&#39;s state and push images into his mind. John asks if the attempt succeeds; The Prophet reports that it does and describes the images he implants: a giant wave of rats, the death blow, and him removing a necklace and placing it on a friend rather than keeping it. John narrates that the attacker drops his weapon, appears to believe The Prophet, and offers audience with the vault leader while holding his sentence of death for twenty-four hours, though much must be decided before that time is up. The Prophet agrees, saying if they fail their mission it won&#39;t matter, so yes. John brings the group into a tented chamber and describes a technological terminal in the back; a refined voice on the line says this is not the regular communication time and asks why they used the emergency channel. John relays that the vault people request the memory module be connected to the terminal to determine the truth, and he asks if the group will allow it. NIX answers &quot;we do it they do it,&quot; Carl Huebner says &quot;big twist,&quot; Sister Mercy asks &quot;what could possibly go wrong,&quot; and Hound Little Dave asks where the machine is and whether he can see it from where he&#39;s standing.</div>

  <div class="entry__summary">John Napiorkowski describes a terminal that pops up showing a very skinny, pale man. The figure notices the screen and seems to back away slightly as people murmur in the background about the wasteland barbarians. Voices on the feed say things like &quot;look at this guy, he&#39;s not even human&quot; and question how anyone could make deals with them. John notes that there are mumblings in the background as you connect the memory module. The module beeps a few times, then the line falls silent on the other end. After the silence, someone on the feed begins to speak, but the transcript ends before the words are captured.</div>

She instructs the party to bring the module to the transmitter station so they can activate the signal from there. The party agrees&mdash;Kristen says &ldquo;yes&rdquo;&mdash;and John prompts whether they want a reward; NIX (Irradiated Shadow) replies &ldquo;always want a reward but nixon people is my reward&rdquo; and volunteers to move. The king produces a map and explains the transmitter lies off his territory in land controlled by another gang, the Purple Rain, which is in the middle of a civil war. He offers to get the party to the border while his people create a diversion to pull away Purple Rain members; The Prophet approves and the king warns that he has held back a coming doom for 24 hours and urges them to finish and leave his territory. The group readies mounts, the king rides out on a multi&#x2011;wheeled motorcycle, they get time to tend wounds, and John brings them to the border while some players trade brief asides&mdash;Stone Mabaso and William Braswell make short comments&mdash;before the scene ends with the party at the border.</div>

  <div class="entry__summary">Carl Huebner says he&#39;ll go for distraction and sympathy, nuzzling against him and trying to make it look like he&#39;s standing with him, and quips that if it&#39;s all charisma checks it&#39;s not the way to play. John asks The Prophet if he&#39;ll help with a mental connection; The Prophet says it&#39;s all he has and reaches into the man&#39;s head to remind him how he loved the dogs and that this is his dog. John describes what The Prophet perceives: a wall around the man&#39;s mind connected to a controller under his chest, like a shiny red button. The Prophet shouts the weakness and explains there&#39;s a control panel under the chest plate that&#39;s controlling the hounds. John confirms Hound (little Dave) is the closest because he ran up into hand-to-hand range; Hound asks if he can aim his club at that spot and decides to try. Hound takes a heavy swing at the chest plate; John narrates that he hits it hard and the blow knocks him out of berserker mode when it knocks him back. John says the chest plate is struck hard and the device under the plate now has to respond.</div>

  <div class="entry__summary">The Prophet says he rides his light cycle and will fire shots through the holes in the wall next round when they get there. John Napiorkowski asks who hasn&#39;t acted; NIX says Will has and points to Stone. John asks Stone if he wants to try something while noting Sister Mercy tried to heal people. Sister Mercy says she has to heal herself because she&#39;s down to one hit, and John tells her she can use the uber pack to bring herself back to full; she agrees. Stone Mabaso says he&#39;ll use a healing pouch to get himself off one hit, mentions his phone is about to die, and the group jokes about using a healing patch on the phone. John confirms the healing pouch restores five points and that using the uber pack would be expended if used. John then reports the enemy remains frozen in the mind thing. Carl Huebner says he needs to leave, the group exchanges farewells, and John says the session will be done in about five minutes and he may leave the game website up. John asks Stone to roll initiative for the party, warns this is a big one and could be the last round, and then notes a roll of six and urges a good roll.</div>

  <div class="entry__summary">The Prophet says he rides his light cycle, mentions a hole and &quot;forced thoughts through the holes in the wall,&quot; and that &quot;next round when we get there.&quot; John Napiorkowski asks who hasn&#39;t gone and calls on Stone, then notes Sister Mercy tried to heal people. NIX tells Stone &quot;will has&quot; and later says &quot;uber pac&quot; and asks to be hooked. Sister Mercy says she must heal herself because she&#39;s down to one hit, and John tells her she can use the uber pack to bring herself back to full; she agrees. Stone Mabaso says he will use a healing pouch, mentions his phone is about to die, and confirms the pouch provides five points to get him off one. John reiterates that you must heal yourself first and that using the uber pack uses it up. After everyone has gone this round, John reports that &quot;he remains frozen in the mind thing.&quot; Carl Huebner announces he needs to leave, thanks everyone and mentions it&#39;s his birthday; KRISTEN responds okay. John says the scene will finish in about five minutes and asks Stone to roll initiative for the party, calling it a big one that could be the last round; NIX responds &quot;ghost on gold.&quot;</div>

  <div class="entry__summary">John calls out that someone is muted and the group settles as the scene unfolds: a control layer in the creature pushes part of its body free, an arm jerks out and a flamer erupts in a strange blue fire. The Prophet and sister Mercy shout warnings &mdash; The Prophet telling others to get out, sister Mercy noting it in chat &mdash; as John describes the blast striking Ember (who resists fire). NIX points out Ember&#39;s fire resistance; John says Ember still takes burning damage but is spared fatal harm. John then turns to The Prophet, who asks if he can still reach the creature&#39;s mind; John affirms he has a better chance and The Prophet reaches in. Inside the mind The Prophet finds warm memories &mdash; trees, dogs, a house, kids, long hair &mdash; and he tries to keep the creature in that space. He tells the group they must destroy a panel at the center of the creature&#39;s chest to break the control. John asks who moves on the panel; NIX says he is plugging in and sister Mercy says she will support NIX with the module, while the others rush forward. Stone strikes the chest module twice; one blow connects and the other fails.</div>

  <div class="entry__summary">John warns the party that the opponent is dangerous and could kill them, then describes the control layer in the enemy taking over and one arm firing a strange blue flamer. The Prophet yells for everyone to get out while Sister Mercy calls to the chat. The flame strikes Ember, who has fire resistance and stands up, but still suffers burning damage; John notes he was lucky not to be killed. John asks the Prophet what he does next; the Prophet asks if he can still affect the enemy&rsquo;s mind, and John says he can &mdash; the control layer is pushing back but the Prophet can see into him. The Prophet reaches into the enemy&rsquo;s memories and finds images of a happy life among trees, dogs, a house and children, then tries to keep him in that space. The Prophet tells the group they must destroy the panel at the center of the enemy&rsquo;s chest; John points out the chest device has to be damaged. NIX says he&rsquo;s plugging in, Sister Mercy says she&rsquo;s fully healed and will support Nick with the module, and the rest rush up to attack the panel. Stone strikes the module twice and succeeds in damaging it.</div>

  <div class="entry__summary">John describes the strike radiating through the device and weakening it. Sister Mercy runs in and takes a swing with her axe/mace toward the module. Hound (little Dave) takes another hit on the plate, saying he has no choice, and lands a solid blow that sends the target to the ground. John tallies the damage and announces the controlled system fails its fail-safe; the wall collapses and the figure&rsquo;s mind begins to flood out. NIX and Sister Mercy move to hook into the antenna; John warns that a mistake could blow it up and kill everyone. NIX connects the interface, the antenna powers up and begins a beeping upload, then the signal reports &ldquo;upload complete.&rdquo; The players trade memories about old TV antennas, rabbit ears, and flat screens while the upload finishes. John narrates that the cyborg drops his weapons&mdash;flamers falling from his arms&mdash;and declares he follows the pack of dogs into the wastelands, turning away without speaking to the group.</div>

  <div class="entry__summary">John Napiorkowski notes the figure looked completely damaged and asks whether the group tries to stop him. Stone Mabaso says they got him back to Nirvana and sent him to a happy place. John agrees that he seemed that way. NIX (Irradiated Shadow) says they must either deal with the vendetta against the king or leave town and never come back. John repeats that &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what he said &mdash; I never come back.&rdquo; The Prophet argues that the man let them go and that was a win. NIX suggests the hound should fight the king; Stone responds that they should use the motorcycle then the guns. Sister Mercy asks if she can go back to the vault, and The Prophet observes the world doesn&rsquo;t end tomorrow so they don&rsquo;t have to rush. John confirms that people don&rsquo;t hear about his good deeds, NIX says the session felt more like Fallout than MAD and that he liked it, and Stone Mabaso and Sister Mercy thank John.</div>

  <div class="entry__summary">John Napiorkowski says he meant to include more car scenes but parts of the session ran slower than expected, so he changed the plan and it ended up feeling more like Fallout. He thanks everyone for coming to his birthday session and says he hopes to make it a recurring event. The Prophet comments that they love the last picture. NIX (Irradiated Shadow) echoes &quot;fall out&quot; and suggests taking a screenshot. Sister Mercy notes they&rsquo;re having tacos. John says he will save the session and put it on the web even after he takes his local site down, explaining the site is currently running from his computer but he will host the content somewhere so everyone can share it. He points out there&rsquo;s a good last picture and tells the group to take it easy. Hound Little Dave thanks John and says Friday nights are perfect for him.</div>
